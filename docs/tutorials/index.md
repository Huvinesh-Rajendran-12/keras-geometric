## Getting Started

- **[Getting Started Guide](getting_started.md)** - Your first steps with Keras Geometric, including basic concepts and simple examples

## Task-Specific Tutorials

- **[Node Classification](node_classification.md)** - Learn to classify nodes in graphs using GCNs and GATs
- **[Graph Classification](graph_classification.md)** - Build models to classify entire graphs using pooling operations

## Advanced Topics

- **[Custom Layers](custom_layers.md)** - Create your own Graph Neural Network layers
- **[Performance Optimization](performance_optimization.md)** - Tips for scaling to large graphs
- **[Multi-Backend Usage](backends.md)** - Using Keras Geometric with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX

## Real-World Examples

- **[Citation Networks](citation_networks.md)** - Working with academic paper citation data
- **[Molecular Property Prediction](molecular_properties.md)** - Predicting chemical properties from molecular graphs
- **[Social Network Analysis](social_networks.md)** - Analyzing social media connections and communities

## Quick Reference
